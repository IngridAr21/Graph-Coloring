# Graph-Coloring
To run the application javafx project should be setted up (IntelliJ recommended). 

To start run the App.java file

You'll see 2 textfields where you can choose to generate random graph(first field), for that you need to specify upperbound of your graph,
 or upload existing one(second field)(upperbound will be automaticcaly set equal to the amount of vertices of chosen graph)
Also you'll see combobox where you can choose gamemode.
When everything setted up you can play
Good luck!

Project done by a group of students at university. My main tasks were Game 1 and Game 2, plus the GUI for the menu
